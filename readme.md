## Key Components

### Responsive Design

The app uses a custom responsive framework that adapts the UI based on screen size:

- `ResponsiveHelper`: Utility class for responsive layouts
- `Responsive` widget: Wrapper to display different widgets based on screen size

### BLoC State Management

State is managed using the BLoC pattern with events and states:

- `ThemeBloc`: Manages app theme (dark/light mode)
- `PortfolioBloc`: Manages portfolio data (projects, experience, etc.)

### Animations

The app includes several optimized animations:

- Type-writer animation for text
- Hover effects on cards
- Staggered animations for lists
- Fade and slide transitions

### Performance Optimization

Several optimizations are implemented:

- Lazy loading
- Minimal rebuilds with const widgets
- Memory-efficient image loading
- Optimized animations

## Customization

### Changing Content

To update the portfolio content, modify the following files:

- `data/models/project_model.dart`: Update project details
- `data/models/experience_model.dart`: Update work experience
- Replace images in `assets/images/` directory

### Theming
